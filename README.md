# Brew & Beans - Coffee Shop Website

This is a complete, production-ready multi-page website generated from a single category prompt (Coffee Shop).

Included pages:
- index.html: Home with hero, features, and gallery
- about.html: Our Story and values
- menu.html: Coffee, pastries, and beverages menu
- contact.html: Contact form and details

Design notes:
- Tailwind CSS (CDN) is used for all styling (no separate CSS files)
- Font pairing per category: Montserrat for headings and Open Sans for body (via Google Fonts)
- Color palette tailored to a coffee shop: rich coffee tones
- All images are placeholders with descriptive alt attributes; replace with actual assets as needed

Usage:
- Open the pages in a modern browser to view the responsive layout
- Internal navigation links connect all pages
- The hero sections include a coffee-shop themed background image placeholder (see 5.3.3 for background image placeholders)

Accessibility & SEO:
- Semantic HTML5 elements (header, nav, main, section, footer)
- Descriptive alt text for all images
- Internal linking between pages for better navigation
- Each page has a unique title and meta description

Notes:
- You can customize copy, images, and color tokens to match your brand.
- If you want to add additional pages (e.g., services, events), I can incrementally modify the site while preserving existing content.
